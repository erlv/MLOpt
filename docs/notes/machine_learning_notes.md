# What is Machine Learning
Field of study which gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Related and Overlaped to:
- computational statistics
- mathematical optimizations

Difference between Machine Learning and Data Mining
- data mining focus on exploratory data analysis, and discover of unknown properties in the data.
    - Machine learning focuses on prediction.
- data mining is a kind of unsupervised learning method
- data mining could be treated as a sub-field of machine learning


The application of Machine Learning is mainly the application which design and
programming explicit algorithms is infeasible:
- Spam filtering
- Optical Character Recognition
- Search Engines
- Computer Vision



# Types of problems and tasks

- Supervised learning: The computer has a "teacher" by showing the inputs and their desired output to them.
- Unsupervised learning: The computer do not get labled data, and it will try to find the structure in its input by itself.
- Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal without a teacher explicitly telling it whether it has come close to its goal.


Other terms for machine learning
- Semi-supervised learnin   
    - Transduction
- Developmental learning
    - robot learning


Based on the desired output of a machine-learning system, the ML could be divided into the following categories:
- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering
- Density Estimation
- Dimensionality Reduction


# Approaches of Machine Learning

## Decision tree Learning
It use a decision tree as a predictive model, which maps observations about an item to conclusion about the item's target value.

## Association rule learning
Try to discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases.

## Artificial Neural Networks
Modern neural networks are non-linear statistical data modeling tools, and they are usually used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs,
to find patterns in data, or to capture the statistical structure in an unknown joint probability distribution between observed variables.find

## Inductive logic programming
it is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses.

## Support Vector Machine
It is a set of related supervised learning method used for classification and regression.

## Clustering

It is the assignment of a set of observations into subset (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to some predesignated criterion or criteria, 
which observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar.
